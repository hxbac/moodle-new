`save-answersheets` tool on your computer. Once you have that:

1. The attempts that will be downloaded when you follow these instructions are based on the settings of the report you just left.
   What this process will do is effectively follow every **Review sheet** link there. So, if you are in any doubt, go back and
   check the report is showing the attempts you want exported.
2. Once you are satisfied, download the [bulk download steps file]({$a->scripturl}) that will tell `save-answersheets` what to do.
   **Don't forget the warning above!**
3. Save that file (which should be called `{$a->scriptname}-steps.txt`) in the same folder where you have `save-answersheets`
   on your computer.
4. Open a command prompt and go to that folder.
5. Type the command `.\save-answersheets '{$a->scriptname}-steps.txt'` and wait for it to run. It outputs what it is doing as it goes.
6. Once the script has finished, you should have a file `{$a->scriptname}.zip` inside the `output` folder.
7. Remember to delete the `{$a->scriptname}-steps.txt` file.

Once you have the file downloaded, if you only want the files for one student, you can run a command like
`.\save-answersheets --download-only 'X1234567' '{$a->scriptname}-steps.txt'`

If you run any of these commands again, they will just download files which have not already been fetched. This can be helpful,
for example if just a few additional students have attempted the quiz.";s:21:"bulkinstructionstitle";s:50:"Instructions for downloading review sheets in bulk";s:23:"bulkinstructionswarning";s:292:"<b>Warning</b>! the file you download in Step 2 of the instructions below contains enough
